# **README.md — DC Housing Qualification Analysis**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a complete statistical analysis of residential property data from Washington, D.C., with the goal of modeling the probability that a property is *qualified* to be sold on the market. The project uses a **binary logistic regression framework**, extensive **data cleaning**, **exploratory visualizations**, **model selection**, and **performance diagnostics** to understand the drivers of property qualification.

The analysis was completed as part of **STAT‑616: Generalized Linear Models**, in collaboration with **Kingsley Iyawe**.

## **Objectives**
The project investigates:

1. What determines whether a property is “qualified” to be sold?
2. Which predictors (price, rooms, grade, condition, AC, heat, etc.) influence qualification?
3. How well can a logistic regression model classify qualified vs. unqualified properties?
4. How do model selection techniques (AIC, BIC, interactions, transformations) affect performance?
5. What visual patterns exist across wards, quadrants, grades, and time?

## **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
The raw dataset required substantial preprocessing:

- Removal of unused or redundant variables  
- Filtering unrealistic or extreme values  
- Recoding categorical variables  
- Creating transformed predictors (e.g., √PRICE, √BEDRM, ROOMS^0.2)  
- Creating a binary outcome variable `QUALIFIED_2`  
- Splitting into **training (80%)** and **validation (20%)** using a *truly random* split  

All cleaning steps were implemented using **tidyverse pipelines** for clarity and reproducibility.

## **Modeling Approach**

### **Models Fit**
The following logistic regression models were evaluated:

- **Basic Model**: PRICE only  
- **Full Model**: All selected predictors, no interactions  
- **AIC‑Selected Model**  
- **BIC‑Selected Model**  
- **Interaction Model**  
- **Final Model**:  
  - Includes transformations  
  - Includes key interactions  
  - Best balance of interpretability and performance  

### **Final Model Formula**
```
QUALIFIED_2 ~ PRICE + sqrt(PRICE) + AC + ROOMS + ROOMS^.2 +
              sqrt(BEDRM) + CNDTN + WARD +
              PRICE:AC + PRICE:ROOMS + PRICE:WARD
```

## **Performance Metrics**

### **Training Metrics**
- Accuracy  
- Sensitivity  
- Specificity  
- Precision  
- F1 Score  
- AUC  

### **Validation Metrics**
Same metrics computed on held‑out data to assess generalization.

---

## **Confusion Matrices**

### **Training Confusion Matrix**
Shows classification performance on the training set using the optimal ROC cutoff.

### **Validation Confusion Matrix**
Evaluates out‑of‑sample predictive accuracy.

## **AUC Comparison Across All Models**

AUC was computed for:

- Basic Model  
- Full Model  
- AIC Model  
- BIC Model  
- **Final Model (highest AUC)**  

This provides a clear ranking of predictive performance.

---

## **Calibration Plot**

A calibration curve was generated by binning predicted probabilities into deciles and comparing:

- **Predicted probability**  
- **Observed proportion of qualified properties**

A well‑calibrated model lies close to the 45° line.

---

## **Lift Chart**

The lift chart evaluates how much better the model performs compared to random selection.  
Higher lift in early deciles indicates strong ranking ability.

---

## **Key Findings**

- **Price is the strongest predictor** of qualification.  
- AC, condition, grade, and ward meaningfully influence qualification.  
- Interaction terms (e.g., PRICE × AC) improve model fit.  
- The final model achieves strong AUC and balanced sensitivity/specificity.  
- Visualizations reveal clear geographic and temporal patterns in pricing and qualification.  
- The model is useful for understanding qualification odds but **not** for pricing prediction (a linear model would be more appropriate for price).

## **Limitations & Future Work**

Future improvements could include:

- More detailed time‑series modeling  
- Sentiment analysis of neighborhoods  
- Additional predictors (heat type, neighborhood rating, school quality)  
- Data collection from realtor websites  
- Expanding to surrounding states (VA, MD, WV)  
- Improved handling of missingness and outliers

# Classification Models

This folder contains R and Python implementations of supervised learning methods used to predict categorical outcomes. Each subfolder represents a specific model, with clean, modular scripts and reproducible workflows.

## Included Methods
- **LDA** – Linear Discriminant Analysis  
- **QDA** – Quadratic Discriminant Analysis  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
- **XGBoost / Gradient Boosting**

## Structure
Each model subfolder includes:
- R script (`.R`)
- Python script (`.py`)

This structure keeps classification methods organized and consistent across languages.

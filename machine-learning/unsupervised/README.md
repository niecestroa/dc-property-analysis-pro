# Unsupervised Learning Models

This folder contains R and Python implementations of unsupervised learning methods used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and structure discovery. Each method is organized into its own subfolder.

## Included Methods
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**
- **PCA** – Principal Component Analysis  
- **t-SNE**
- **UMAP**

## Structure
Each model subfolder includes:
- R script (`.R`)
- Python script (`.py`)

This structure keeps unsupervised methods cleanly separated and easy to extend.
